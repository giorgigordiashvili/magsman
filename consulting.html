            other characteristics. A communication platform of the brand is the
            second phase which connects an already unified brand with the
            audience - for this, I visually bring the brand to life, form the
            communication language and share its experience with the customer.
            At the end of these major steps I choose different communication
            channels and make a required strategy for the brand to exist in
            these channels. Finally, I successfully manage these channels to
            increase the popularity of the brand as well as to stimulate sales
            and encourage customers. If you need my help with just one or a few
            aspects, please, contact me.
